#Notes
I learned tons from this assignment. I think I had originally made some kind of mistake while cloning the repository and it was pretty stressful. However, after some stress, I finally figured it out. I am feeling a lot more confident using the terminal on VS Code as well as using GitHub and communicating between the two. One of the most important things I learned was the importance of making sure I was in the right directory.

Elevator pitch: 
Have you ever played the Oregon Trail game that was released back in the 70â€™s? Maybe you've read a Choose Your Own Adventure book as a kid. Our new app is designed to bring back the fun and nostalgia of a simple game where you can affect the outcome by making choices. Eventually, we hope to have a variety of themes to choose from, but right now we are focusing on a mission to space. This app will allow you to make an account, choose your path through a series of exciting scenes, and see how you compare to other players that day.

HTML and CSS:
I learned tons about how to use Bootstrap while making this simple application. I have never used Bootstrap before, so it was a good learning experience. I found an online tool where I could change the color scheme in Bootstrap to make it a bit more like space.
