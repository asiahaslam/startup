      <p><b>10</b> <em>And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.</em></p>
      <p><b>11</b> <em>And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.</em></p>
      <p><b>12</b> <em>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;</em></p>
      <p><b>13</b> <em>Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.</em></p>
