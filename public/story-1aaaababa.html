    <p>Wearing their spacesuits, <span class="user"></span> and Kristin disembark from the shuttle and step onto the rocky surface of the comet.</p>
    <p>The sky&mdash;if you could call it that&mdash;is flickering green, as if it were filled with intense aurora borealis.</p>
    <p>As <span class="user"></span> inspects the ship, they find a thin layer of gray foam-like substance coating the metal. It is solid to the touch, as if it were made of iron.</p>
    <p>At the back of the ship, <span class="user"></span> finds that the substance had formed in such a way that it had partially dislodged one of the fuel cells, which was charred and mangled. It&apos;s clear that even a few more moments in flight could have led to disaster.</p>
