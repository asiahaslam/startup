      <p>Not knowing what else to do, the team tries thinking at the creature. &quot;We intend no harm. We did not know that there was life here. We have been looking for a safe place for our people to live,&quot; they say. </p>
      <p>Remarkably, the creature seems to understand them. They hear a voice in their heads that says, &quot;We understand. We see that you are harmless. Your people can live on this planet under one condition: they must leave us alone under the ground, and you must not tell them that we are here. If these terms are not kept, know what we are capable of.&quot;</p>
